This repository contains my practice assignments and projects from the HTML and CSS course. Each folder includes individual exercises that demonstrate key concepts like:

Basic HTML structure and tags

Styling with CSS

Lists, images, and links

Page layouts and navigation

JavaScript integration (in later projects)

This repo will grow as I progress through the course, showcasing my learning and development in web design and front-end coding.
